## Start of the Assembly

- Go to the 3d-printing-stl folder in the github to get the stl files for 3D printing 
- First, print the optic bracket stl file, then install M2 heat inserts into the optic bracket (red arrows below)
- Install M2.5 heat inserts (yellow arrows below)

- Connect the long ribbon cable to the adapter board (ensure the orientation of the ribbon cable is correct, see image below)
- Then, connect the display to the adapter board (ensure the orientation of the adapter board is correct, see image below)

- Pull the ribbon cable through the hole in the optic bracket (red arrows in images below)
- Carefully fold the display cable and insert both the display and the adapter board into the slot of the optic bracket

- When inserting, you will need some force to make it all the way in

- Use the display_holder_left stl file and display_holder_right stl file to print the display holder for left side and right side to secure the display with an M2x8 screw

- Repeat the steps from above for the second display

- Use the electronic-bay stl file to print it out and install M2 heat inserts into it (see red arrows below)

- Connect the USB hub to the display driver using the 12-pin FFC cable
- Secure the USB hub with two M2x4 screws (do not secure the display driver yet)

- Secure the electronics bay to the optic bracket with four M2x5 screws (see red arrows below)

- Connect the left and right displays to the display driver (ensure the orientation of the ribbon cable is correct (see image below)

- Secure the display driver with an M2x5 screw

- Then use the electronic_lid stl file to print out the lid
  
- Then, carefully route all cables through the designated slots (see image above)
- Secure the lid with five M2x5 screws

- Secure the combiner with two M2x8 screws (see red arrows) and two M2 self-tapping screws (see yellow arrows)

- Use the strap_adapter_1_left stl and strap_adapter_1_right stl to print out the straps
- Secure the left and right head strap adapters with M2x8 screws (see red arrows)
